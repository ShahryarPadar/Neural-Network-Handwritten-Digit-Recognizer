A **GUI application** for recognizing handwritten digits using a simple neural network.

## Adding Your Own Images

If you want to test the application with your own images, here are some recommendations to get the best results:

- **Handwritten style**: Try to write digits or characters clearly, similar to MNIST dataset style.  
- **Minimal background noise**: Use images with plain or uniform backgrounds to avoid confusing the model.  
- **Good contrast**: Make sure the text is dark enough and stands out from the background.  

- **Single character per image**: For better accuracy, each image should contain only one digit

Following these guidelines will help the model recognize your handwritten input more accurately.

## Future Updates

Currently, the application only predicts handwritten digits. Upcoming features:

### Next Update
- Improved digit prediction accuracy
- Support for recognizing English words

### Following Update
- Recognizing full English sentences

## Features

- Developed with **Tkinter + ttk + tkinterdnd2**  
- Draw digits on the **canvas** or **upload/drag-and-drop images** from your computer  
- Image preprocessing: resize to **28x28**, grayscale conversion, and normalization  
- Digit prediction using a **three-layer neural network**  
- Save your canvas drawings as **PNG, JPG, or JPEG**  
- Dark theme for an appealing UI  
- User-friendly **info, warning, and error messages**

## üöÄ Replacing the Model

If you have a **better model**, you can place it inside the `models/` folder.  
Make sure that your custom model follows the same **layer architecture**:

- **Input layer**: 784 neurons (for 28x28 pixel MNIST images)  
- **Hidden layer 1**: 256 neurons  
- **Hidden layer 2**: 128 neurons  
- **Output layer**: 10 neurons (digits 0‚Äì9)
